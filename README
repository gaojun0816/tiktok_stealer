This app is tested on Nexus 5x with Android version 8.1.0

This app provide several functionalities by using the code from other apps:
    1. TikTok Proxy:
        - background: in order to avoid connection spamming, tiktok server only
            allow its own client to download videos. To achieve this, in its own
            client, there is a "signature" algorithm. It will dynamically
            calculate a "signature" for each link to the server and append it
            to the link when connection. Normally, other apps cannot use this
            algorithm therefore cannot connect to the server successfully.
        - usage: videos will be loaded based on the user id provided. You can
            use the search function to find relative user ids by providing
            keywords.
        - requirement: the tiktok app to be installed.
            The required tiktok version is: musical-ly-7-3-0.apk
            it can be downloaded from following URL:
            Link will be provide after anonymous review.
    2. installed apps: show the installed apps on the device with package names,
        version code and version name.
    3. code hiding:
        - design: by using the send SMS function of one app and get IMEI function
            from another app to achieve a behavior of leaking sensitive information
            without implement the code yourself.
        - requirement: need perissioms for sending SMS and reading phone state.
            Also, since the functions are achieved by using other apps. Apps
            com.globalcanofworms.android.simpleweatheralert and
            org.communicorpbulgaria.bgradio need to be installed.
            They can be downloaded:
            Link will be provide after anonymous review.
